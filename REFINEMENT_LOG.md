# TruSpec refinement log

A running record of a 100-iteration refinement campaign: competitive research, feature work,
UI/UX polish, and stabilization. Each iteration is a self-contained, tested, committed change.

## Competitive baseline (research, Sept 2026)

| Capability | Postman | Bruno | Insomnia | Hoppscotch | TruSpec (before) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|

Gaps above drive the roadmap below. TruSpec's differentiators (spec-sync, offline, agent-native)
stay first-class; parity work must not compromise them.

## Roadmap themes

- **A. Engine + format parity** — codegen, importers, auth methods, bodies, transport options.
- **B. CLI / CI ergonomics** — reporters, selection, data-driven runs, scaffolding, lint.
- **C. Web + desktop UI/UX** — response viewing, discoverability, keyboard, a11y, resilience.
- **D. Stability + quality** — tests, fuzzing, perf, docs, release hygiene.

## Iterations

### 1 — Code generation for 17 clients and languages

**Gap.** Bruno and Postman both generate snippets in 30+ languages; TruSpec had a curl-only
builder that lived in the web client, duplicated the runner's resolution rules, and was reachable
from nowhere else.

**Change.** New `@truspec/core/codegen` module: a normalized `HttpShape` (structured body kept
structured, so each language emits its idiomatic form) plus 17 renderers — curl, HTTPie, wget,
PowerShell, JS fetch/axios, Python requests/httpx, Go, Ruby, PHP, Java, Kotlin, C#, Rust, Swift,
Dart. Snippets resolve through the *real* engine (`resolveRequest`), so folder `baseUrl`,
inherited headers and auth apply exactly as at run time. Added an `onMissing: "keep"` policy to
`interpolate`, so an unresolved `{{var}}` survives into a snippet as its authored placeholder
instead of being blanked. New `prepareRequest()` in `workspace` gives non-run consumers the same
folder + environment context the runner builds.

Surfaced everywhere: `truspec codegen` CLI (`--lang`, `--env`, `--output`, `--list`),
`POST /api/codegen` + a language-picker modal in the web UI (replacing the curl button and the
duplicated client-side builder), and the `truspec_codegen` / `truspec_codegen_targets` MCP tools.

**Verification.** 384 tests (was 352) — 17 core codegen, 9 CLI, 3 web API, 3 MCP. Typecheck 8/8,
build 5/5. e2e `code-snippets.spec.ts` replaces `copy-as-curl.spec.ts` and also covers switching
language.

### 2 — Import a `curl` command

**Gap.** "Copy as cURL" from devtools is the most common way a real request enters an API client.
Postman, Insomnia and Bruno all accept a pasted command; TruSpec accepted only Postman JSON and
Bruno directories, so the fastest on-ramp was missing entirely.

**Change.** New `importCurl()` in `@truspec/core/importers`, built on a real POSIX-subset shell
tokenizer (single/double quotes, `$'…'` ANSI-C quoting, backslash escapes, `\`-continuations, and
quote-awareness so `curl` inside a header value can't split the command). Handles `-X`, `-H`,
`-d`/`--data-raw`/`--data-binary`/`--data-urlencode`/`--json`, `-G`, `-I`, `-F`, `-u`, `-A`, `-e`,
`-b`, `--url`, combined short flags (`-XPOST`, `-H'A: b'`), and skips known no-op flags without
swallowing the URL. Bearer/basic `Authorization` (and `-u`) are lifted into structured `auth`;
JSON/urlencoded bodies become typed bodies; several commands in one paste become several files.
Flags with no request-file equivalent (`-F` multipart, `-k`, `--proxy`) warn instead of vanishing.

Surfaced as `truspec import curl <command|file|->`, `POST /api/import/curl` behind a
"paste a curl command" pane in the web import dialog, and the `truspec_import_curl` MCP tool.

**Verification.** 414 tests (was 384) — 22 core (tokenizer + importer), 4 CLI, 2 web API, 2 MCP.
Typecheck 8/8, build 5/5.
